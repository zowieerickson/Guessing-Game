# Guessing-Game
Guess a number between 1 - 20. The max score begins at 20, and every time a wrong guess occurs, the score will decrease by 1. 
Also, when a wrong guess occurs, the game will inform the user whether their guess was too high or too low compared to the secret number. 
Once the secret number is guessed correctly, the user wins. 
There is a high score that is displayed, and when a user beats their high score, it will update. 
There is also a "play again" function, allowing the user to keep their high score and to reset the game for another run.
